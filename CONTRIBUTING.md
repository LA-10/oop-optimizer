## 📂 Repo Structure (Key Parts)

* `core/` – optimization logic
* `benchmark/` – benchmark functions
* `cli/` – Click CLI entry points
* `plots/` – plot rendering
* `examples/` – runnable shell scripts and precomputed CSVs

---

## 🔍 Code Style

* Use `black` for formatting
* Prefer `click.echo()` over `print()`
* Follow existing function signatures
* Keep CLI logic separate from algorithm logic

---

## 🧪 Testing (Coming Soon)

* Tests will live under `tests/`
* Use `pytest` and `unittest`
* Separate CLI tests and core logic tests
